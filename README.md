# DLA

Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA): A seed particle is placed at the origin. One by one particles diffuse in a Brownian motion 
until they enounter the existing fixed structure. When they hit this structure, they attach to it and a new particle is 
released from very far away. 

I am experimenting with quadtrees and kd tree to improve collision detection speed, in order to make bigger aggregates. This is
my first Java project, so it's just for playing around. Run exampleDLA to see it work (hopefully).
